Hi there, fellow developer,
Here is the middleware I just built for the challenge. 
It works.
However due to a lack of time, I was not able to implement some steps.

- Only a couple unit tests were built.
- I wanted to implement caching but ended up just writing the token in a txt file.
- Didnt implement the token renovation if it was expired.
- Didnt put any linter configuration.

Have a nice day.
